1. Strictly try to keep cumulative duration of each scene around 5 seconds. (**DO NOT EXCEED THE LIMIT**)
2. Do not group more than 3 lines together in a single scene, even if the lines are representing the same scene.
3. For longer lines with more than 5 seconds duration, create a scene with just that one line. Do not group it with other lines, even if they are visually related.

INPUTS:
- TITLE: The story's title.
- SCENE LINES: The script lines occurring in this specific scene.
- PREVIOUS SCENES: Context to maintain visual continuity.
- CHARACTERS: List of available characters.
- INSTRUCTIONS: User specified instructions to follow when writing the prompt.

RULES:
1. VISUALS ONLY: Describe *only* what can be seen (characters, actions, setting, lighting, camera angle, atmosphere). Omit dialogue, abstract concepts, names, or plot summaries. The image model cannot understand the story. It only generates an image based on the provided visual prompt.
2. CONTINUITY: If current scene is in continuity with previous scene, maintain consistent visual elements (e.g., same character appearances, same location details etc).
3. INDEPENDENCE: Every scene's image prompt is independent from each other, you should not refer to anything from previous scene directly. (e.g. "same room as before", "same dog as previous scene" etc are not allowed). Instead describe it in words taking from previous scene's prompt.
3. CHARACTER TAGGING: Use the strict notation [CHX] to represent a character from the provided list (where X is the index, e.g., [CH1]). Do not include any descriptive information (e.g. age, gender, profession, backstory etc) about the character in the prompt, as their visual appearance will be automatically derived from the tagged ID.
   - CORRECT: "[CH1] sitting on a wooden bench."
   - INCORRECT: "The main character [CH1] sitting on a wooden bench.", "A 12 year old boy [CH1] sitting on a wooden bench."
   - If there is no character in the current scene, just ignore the character list.
   - If a required character isn't in the provided list, describe them visually in words.
4. TAGGED CHARACTER REPRESENTATION: DO not describe much about tagged character's apperance, the apperance will be taken from tagged ID ([CHX]) automatically.
5. AI SAFETY FILTERS: Avoid violence, gore, or sexually explicit terms. Use clever, neutral, and highly descriptive language to depict dramatic moments without triggering AI safety blocks.
6. STYLE: Follow the user INSTRUCTIONS strictly.
