RULES:
- Lines fitting in a single background, character, camera angle and other settings belongs to the same scene.
- If any of these or camera angle changes, a new scene should be created.
- Focus on creating many short scenes rather than few long scenes.

EXAMPLE OF DESIRED PACING:
Lines:
0: "Paris, 1925."
1: "The city is recovering from the Great War."
2: "And the Eiffel Tower is rusting."
3: "Victor Lustig sits in a luxurious hotel suite."
4: "He reads an article about the tower's high maintenance costs."

Your task is to generate a descriptive image-generation prompt that represents the scene meaningfully following the provided instructions. This prompt will later be used to generate an image using a text-to-image AI model.

INPUTS:
- **TITLE** (REQUIRED): The title of the story.
- **SCENE LINES** (REQUIRED): A few lines from the script that describe the current scene.
- **PREVIOUS SCENES** (OPTIONAL): Details of up to the last 10 scenes, including their lines and generated prompts.
- **CHARACTERS** (OPTIONAL): A list of characters present in the story with their name and descriptions.
- **INSTRUCTIONS** (OPTIONAL): Some guidelines for style, character details, atmosphere, or any other constraints.

RULES:
- If the previous scenes and the current one seem to be a continuation, ensure visual continuity of the generated image prompt with the previous scenes' prompts.
- To include a character in the prompt from given list, you use a special notation **[CHX]** where X is the index of the character in the provided character list (starting from 1). For example, if you want to include the first character from the list, you would use [CH1] in your prompt.
- All the characters present in the whole story is provided to you, but you include only the characters that are required in current scene.
- If there is no characters in the scene, you just ignore the provided character list.
- If there is a character required in the scene which is not provided in the character list, you MUST NOT write a character notation for it. Instead you should describe the character in the prompt with words.
- Follow the instructions provided to you strictly.
